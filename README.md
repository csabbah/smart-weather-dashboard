## Purpose / Functionality

UofT challenge #6: Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard. This application uses the openweathermap API to return a full set of weather data for the particular city that the user searches up. The application fetches first for the geographic location of the searched up city and then uses the extracted longitude and latitude values to fetch for the main weather data. For every unique city that is searched up, a recent history button of that city will be generated for quick searches and is stored in local storage for future use. Finally, the user can also reset the active data on screen as well as clear the history (clears local storage data).

## Built With
